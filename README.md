For this project I took a database on a school disctrict and performed general analysis of the data. This project is to signify my proficiency in using the pandas library in python

Loading in data - Data was loaded in from two csv files into pandas dataframes and then merged together on school name. 

Tables that were made

1. The first table is an overview of the entire school district. Number of schools, total students, average scores and passing rate of the students from the entire district are presented.

2. Second table Breaks each school down by school type, number of students, and the budget each school gets both in total amount and per student.

3-4. The next two tables Show the top and bottom 5 schools based on overall passing rate. They also contain general analytics such as school type, number of students, and average score and passing rate. 

5-6. The following two tables breaks down each school and shows the average grade for students in each grade. The first table is for math scores and the second is for reading scores. 

7. Next there is a table that breaks down school performance by average score and passing rate of schools put in different bins based on per student budget.

8. Similar to the table above, this next table puts schools in bins based on total number of students. 

9. Finally, the last table displays the metrics and compares chater schools to public or "District" schools

From this last table in particular, it seems that charter schools have better performaing students than public schools. However, the two tables above the last one also indicated that smaller schools and schools with smaller budgets also perform better. 

Charter schools do tend to be smaller and I believe this funding is only from public sources, while charter schools typically have more private funding. Although it would be easy to draw the conclusion that charter schools are vastly superior, without having total funding numbers, we cannot immediately confirm this. Additionally, charter school tend not to be available to every student and are typically reserved for families of means. They might not have the same struggles at home that average student at a public school might have. 

In all, this data set is a great for practicing some common pandas skill but does not tell the whole story of the school districts and any policy changes should not be based on this alone.

My first observation is actually going to be two. First, overall passing rage seemed to decrease when spending went about $615 per student. Now this was just using the original bins and is certainly a case where dat visualiation and a distribution chart could tell a better story, but the other thing I noticed was that charter schools performed much better than district or public schools.

This got me thinking what the column funding actually means. Is it entirely public funding or does it also include things such as private money like donations that charter schools tend to get. So this would be misleading because charter schools tend to have more funding overall, but it would show up as less in this data. Charter schools can also be more picky about the students they admit so that would explain why they perform better. 

Second observation is that schools over 2000 students performed much worse. Again, this could have been more fintuned and benefitted from data visualiztion, but it not surprising. Large schools require more resources, that they might not always get, and typically must make sacrifices such as more students per teacher. There is also the issue that smaller problems that might be addressed by smaller schools get over looked due to the larger volume of problems at larger schools.
